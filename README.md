This is a small demo built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It lets you clone a short voice sample, generate a Mother's Day poem, and schedule a phone call that reads the poem using your cloned voice.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies (requires Node 18+):

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
CARTESIA_API_KEY=your-cartesia-key
VAPI_API_KEY=your-vapi-key
TWILIO_MOTHERS_DAY_NUMBERS=[{"id":"pn_xxxxx"}]
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying files inside the `app/` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Running Tests

Simple unit tests are located in the `tests/` folder. Run them with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Voice Data

Voice recordings are uploaded to Cartesia only for cloning. If you would like to remove the cloned voice, send a POST request to `/api/assistant/delete-voice` with the `voiceId` returned when cloning.

## Customization

When generating a poem you can choose a short or long length, edit the poem before continuing, and modify the first message that will be spoken during the call.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
